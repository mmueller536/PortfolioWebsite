# Resume Website for Michael Mueller

## Ongoing Project Utilizing Bootstrap for Web Development
This is an ongoing project to develop a resume/portfolio website for myself utilizing the tools provided
by Bootstrap.

The beginning of this project began from the Starting Resume Theme provided by Start Bootstrap. This theme has been modified, however is a substantial foundation for the CSS, structure of the HTML, and the JS of this page. Without this amazing theme, this webstie would not look nearly as it would without this theme, and I highly endorse Start Bootstrap as a learning source for Bootstrap
